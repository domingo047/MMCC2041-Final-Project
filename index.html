            <h1>1932–1949: The Beginning of LEGO</h1>
            <p>
            LEGO originated in 1932 when Ole Kirk Christiansen, a carpenter from Billund, Denmark,
            began producing wooden furniture and household goods during the Great Depression.
            Economic pressure forced him to pivot into smaller products that required less material, and
            he eventually began crafting wooden toys. These toys included cars, ducks, and yo-yos,
            all hand-carved and polished. In 1934, Christiansen renamed his workshop to "LEGO,"
            derived from the Danish phrase “Leg Godt,” meaning “play well.” This simple phrase would
            eventually become the philosophical foundation for the company’s direction.
            </p>
            <p>
            The workshop struggled financially for years, and Christiansen was forced to take risks
            to continue operating. He reinvested profits into improving product quality, believing that
            children deserved well-built toys regardless of the family's financial situation. In 1942, the
            factory caught fire and destroyed most of the wooden toy inventory. Rather than quitting, he
            rebuilt and took on this disaster as a turning point. In 1947, LEGO purchased one of the first
            plastic injection molds in Denmark. The decision was controversial because plastic was not
            considered a premium material at the time. Many believed parents would never buy “cheap
            plastic toys.”
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1949, LEGO released its first plastic product: the “Automatic Binding Brick.” Although
            not identical to the modern LEGO brick, it introduced the idea of interlocking construction.
            These early plastic bricks represented a shift not just in materials, but in thinking. LEGO
            was no longer creating toys—it was creating a building system.

            <h1>1950–1972: Establishing the System of Play</h1>
            <p>
            During the 1950s and 1960s, LEGO evolved from simply producing toys into designing
            a structured and intentional building system. In 1954, the concept of the “LEGO System of
             emerged. The core idea was that every piece produced must work with past and future
            pieces. This marked a radical shift in the toy industry, which traditionally focused on
            standalone items that offered limited longevity. The System of Play created a universal
            building language that encouraged imagination without restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1958, LEGO patented the modern brick still used today. Its internal tube-and-stud
            system improved clutch power and stability, making structures far more durable. To further
            expand creativity, the first set of LEGO wheels was introduced in 1962. Wheels allowed
            children to build cars, trucks, and machinery for the first time, establishing motion as part of
            construction play. LEGO also began producing instruction manuals in 1964. Unlike
            traditional toys, LEGO manuals encouraged problem solving, following sequences, and
            independent thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1968, LEGO entered a completely new domain—theme parks. LEGOLAND Billund
            opened and attracted more than 600,000 visitors in its first year. It served as a physical
            celebration of the brand’s creativity and proven the scale of LEGO’s cultural impact. By
            the early 1970s, LEGO began producing products for classroom use, experimenting with the
            concept of structured learning through building. These early education kits laid the
            foundation for what would eventually become LEGO Education.

            <h1>1973–1998: World-Building, Characters, and Engineering</h1>
            <p>
            The 1970s through the late 1990s marked the transformation of LEGO from a building
            material into a storytelling medium. In 1978, LEGO introduced the modern minifigure. It
            featured a simple smiley face and movable limbs, intentionally designed so that any child,
            regardless of background, could project narratives and emotions onto the character. The
            minifigure became the visual identity of the brand.
            </p>
            <p>
            LEGO then introduced themed worlds such as Space, Castle, and Town. These themes
            allowed children to build coherent environments instead of random structures. By
            organizing sets around narratives, LEGO shifted from a “building toy” to a creativity and
            storytelling tool. In 1980, LEGO established a professional design department, adopting
            computer-aided design to maintain consistent quality and open the door to more complex
            models. In 1986, the Technic line launched. Technic introduced gears, axles, and pneumatic
            components, encouraging engineering thinking and functional mechanical design.
            </p>
            <p>
            The early 1990s saw LEGO achieve global cultural visibility. The company broke multiple
            Guinness World Records, including the tallest LEGO tower and largest LEGO castle. In
            1996, LEGO.com launched and expanded the brand into digital spaces. In 1998, LEGO
            introduced Mindstorms, allowing children to build programmable robots. Mindstorms was a
            pivotal moment—it blurred the boundary between play and STEM learning, influencing
            future robotic and engineering education programs worldwide.

            <h1>1999–2010: Licensing and Survival</h1>
            <p>
            This era began with one of the most significant business moves LEGO had ever made: the
            launch of LEGO Star Wars in 1999. This marked the company’s first major licensing
            partnership, proving that combining storytelling universes with LEGO construction could
            attract new and older audiences. The success of Star Wars led to additional collaborations,
            including Harry Potter, which expanded LEGO’s reach into mainstream entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, success led to overconfidence. Between 2001 and 2003, LEGO expanded into
            too many non-core markets, including theme parks, clothing, and large lifestyle products.
            This caused severe financial loss and nearly resulted in bankruptcy. In 2004, LEGO
            executives made a decisive course correction. They eliminated product lines that did not
            support building and returned to the design philosophy that every LEGO set should enrich
            the System of Play. Production was simplified, budgets reduced, and manufacturing
            outsourced strategically.
            </p>
            <p>
            By 2010, LEGO’s comeback was complete. The company doubled down on quality,
            returned manufacturing focus to core brick-based sets, and expanded strategically into
            digital gaming. LEGO proved that growth did not come from producing more products, but
            from maintaining compatibility, creativity, and design excellence.

            <h1>2010–Present: Culture, Innovation, and Sustainability</h1>
            <p>
            In the 2010s, LEGO became more than a toy brand: it became a cultural icon. In 2014,
            “The LEGO Movie” was released, shifting public perception of the brand from a children’s
            toy to a cross-media storytelling franchise. The film highlighted LEGO’s core values:
            creativity, collaboration, and imagination. The positive reception demonstrated the enduring
            emotional connection people have with the brick throughout their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
            LEGO Ideas, an online platform where fans submit and vote on set concepts, further
            reinforced LEGO’s collaborative identity. Sets such as the Saturn V Rocket, Friends Central
            Perk, and fan-designed castles show that LEGO now co-creates with its community. Beyond
            entertainment, LEGO committed heavily to sustainability. The company began producing
            plant-based polyethylene bricks and experimenting with recycled PET materials. LEGO also
            announced goals to phase out non-sustainable plastics and achieve carbon-neutral
            manufacturing.
            </p>
            <p>
            Today LEGO continues to influence design, education, and engineering. The brick remains
            relevant because LEGO never abandoned its defining principle: every element, regardless of
            year, must connect. It is a rare example of innovation built on permanence.
